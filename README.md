## Backend for Google Sheets (Live Charts)

This project now includes a backend API at `backend/server.js` that reads your Google Sheet and exposes:

- `GET /api/team-counts`
- `GET /api/health`

### Configure

Set these environment variables before starting backend:

- `PORT` (default: `8080`)
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` (default already set to your provided sheet ID)
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_GID` (default: `991151321`)
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE` (optional)

### Run

```sh
# terminal 1 (backend)
npm run server

# terminal 2 (frontend)
# Windows PowerShell example:
$env:VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
npm run dev
```

The frontend polls every 5 seconds and updates charts from `/api/team-counts`.
